DESCRIPTION

Triply allows the user to create and store a day-by-day vacation itinerary in an easy-to-read format.

Triply was inspired by my obsessive need to plan my vacations down to every last detail. The app gives the user the option to search for attractions and activities in a desired location and add those they're interested in to a daily itinerary. Users can plan multiple trips at the same time and store them inside the app. A Leaflet map utilizing OpenStreetMaps displays the locations of chosen activities on the itinerary's page, and each activity is linked to its Yelp page.

FEATURES

- User login
- Autofill location searching
- Entry of flight/hotel info
